# hascheme

An (almost certainly buggy and incomplete) implementation of scheme, written in haskell.

Very much based on [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), with a few notable differences. E.g. more complete number parsing, let expressions, etc.
